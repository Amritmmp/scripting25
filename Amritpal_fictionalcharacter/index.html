    <h2>About Doraemon</h2>
    <p>
      Doraemon is a robot cat from the 22nd century who comes back in the past to help a boy named Nobita Nobi. 
      He is sent by Nobita's great-great-grandson to transform Nobita's life in the current era so that his 
      children will have a better future. Doraemon is blue, earless (due to an accident with a machine), and 
      stores new technology inside a 4D pocket. He travels with Nobita in present-day Tokyo and is a supportive 
      partner to Nobita's daily problems and activities. By showing so many stories, Doraemon's life consists of 
      ordinary human emotions and next-generation technology and therefore this cartoon world is both funny and rational.

  <!-- SECTION 2: Personality -->
  <section id="personality">
    <h2>Personality & Habits</h2>
    <p>
      Doraemon has a huge but generous, human-like, and strict personality. He constantly tries to give Nobita 
      good advice despite Nobita's habitual unawareness. Doraemon loves <em>dorayaki</em> (bean cakes) and has 
      an easily distracted mind when food is involved. He dislikes mice, as they remind him of the accident in 
      which he lost his ears. Though originally a robot, Doraemon shows very human emotions—he laughs, scolds, 
      and even gets frightened. Most of the time, his task is to assist Nobita in fixing problems with devices, 
      but often the gadgets cause more trouble.

  <!-- SECTION 3: Gadgets -->
  <section id="gadgets">
    <h2>Gadgets & Skills</h2>
    <p>
      The most iconic feature of Doraemon is his 4D pocket containing endless futuristic gadgets. Among his 
      favorite gadgets are:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Take-copter:</strong> A propeller that lets you fly in the air.</li>
      <li><strong>Anywhere Door:</strong> A doorway that leads anywhere in the world instantly.</li>
      <li><strong>Time Machine:</strong> A machine hidden in Nobita's desk drawer that allows time travel.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      These gadgets are symbols of imagination, intelligence, and creativity, but must be used wisely. Doraemon 
      depicts concepts of responsibility and friendship through these devices.

  <!-- SECTION 4: Friends -->
  <section id="friends">
    <h2>Friends & Relationships</h2>
    <p>
      Doraemon is fond of Nobita and acts like an elder brother and caretaker to him. He never fails to rescue 
      Nobita from school problems, bullies, and other daily issues. Doraemon's closest friends include Shizuka, 
      Gian, and Suneo, even though there are constant fights with Gian and Suneo. His friendship with Shizuka 
      resembles that of a father since he helps Nobita pursue her. Despite Nobita's repeated misuse of gadgets, 
      Doraemon never abandons him. Through these friendships, Doraemon develops loyalty, trust, and deep bonds 
      that showcase the values of teamwork and care.
